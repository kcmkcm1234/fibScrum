fibScrum
========

An Android app for Fibonnaci based Scrum estimation.


This is a very simple app for Scrum Estimation (see http://scrummethodology.com/scrum-effort-estimation-and-story-points/).

Specifically, it is designed for the method used at Lucid Software, Inc., that is using the fibonnaci sequence for story points,
with the addition of 1/2, 1/4, and 1/8 for very small stories.

The main view is simply a list of available story point estimations. Clicking on any of them, switches to a new screen with the
number as larger text, to hold up during estimation.
